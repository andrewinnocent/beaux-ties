# Beaux-Ties E-commerce Site

My capstone project at GA. "Beaux-Ties" is an e-commerce site where a user can view, add to wishlist, and add to a shopping cart bowties. "Beaux" is "beautiful" or "handsome" (in the plural form) in French.

### Technologies Used

- EmberJS
- JavaScript
- Font Awesome
- Bootstrap
- Toastr

### Planning Process & Problem-solving Strategy
I planned to work on the API the first three days of project week then focus on building the front-end for the remainder of the time. I ended up working on both concurrently as many changes to functionalities required adjusting both.

With only four days of EmberJS training in the classroom, it was a HUGE learning curve and challenge to build this project. The issue queue was used, questions were asked to peers, and much googling was done in order to overcome the challenges.

### Version 2.0

- Order history
- Proper shopping cart functionality (summarize by bow-tie name, render total price, change quantity, etc.)
  - Strip API
- Search by color or style
- Wishlist functionality in /beauxs/:id view
- Remove bow-ties in /wishlist view
